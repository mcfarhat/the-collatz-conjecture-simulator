=== Short Summary ===

The Collatz Conjecture Simulator plugin allows testing of the mathematical conjecture against any positive integer submitted into it, and displaying the results. It can be easily incorporated into any wordpress based installation

== Description ==

The plugin allows you, via using a simple shortcode [collatz_simulator], to insert the simulator into any page on your wordpress site, and making it privately or publicly available for usage and/or testing.

The collatz conjecture is a mathematical series of calculations that given any integer number, performing n/2 (if number is even( and 3n+1 (if number is odd) repetitive calculations according to the algorithm, would eventually converge the number to 1.

The user on the interface would then use the input field "Starting Number" to provide the integer value, which is validated for correct input.

Following which, the Collatz sequence will be generated, and results will be displayed below, converging into the 4, 2, 1 sequence at the end.

If it does not converge, please notify us instantaneously, as you might have cracked the code into breaking the conjecture lol

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/the-collatz-conjecture-simulator` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Go to a page or create a new page
4. Insert the plugin code into the text editor [collatz_simulator]
5. That's it! Now you can visit that page from front end, and play around with the simulator
